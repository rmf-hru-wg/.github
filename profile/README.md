We work with individuals and groups to create humanoid robots.  
This Working Group Repository is publish space for software and hardware in our activity.  

> [!NOTE]
> Since alumni and alumnae work together, activities by members outside the university are also included.
> Unlike official repositories managed by universities, the activities are mainly conducted by amateur members.
